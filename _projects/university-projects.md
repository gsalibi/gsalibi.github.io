## Artificial Intelligence (2019)

This course was taken in 2019-1 at Unicamp. You can find the complete project in <a
    href="https://github.com/gsalibi/artificial-intelligence-course" target="_blank">this repository</a>.
Introductory study of the fundamentals and applications of Artificial Intelligence. History and principles of AI.
Problem solving. Knowledge representation. Applications. The following topics have been covered:

- AI history and principles
- Smart agents
- Search without information, search with information and competitive search.
- Genetic algorithms
- Constraint satisfaction problem
- Evolutionary computing
- Planning
- Fuzzy systems
- Uncertainty and Bayesian Networks
- Machine learning
- Learning models (supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised)
- Decision trees
- Neural networks
- Markov Models and Reinforcement Learning
- AI topics

Used technologies: Python, C#,
As a complement to the course, we had to implement 4 projects that are described below.


##### Project 1 - Graph Search Algorithms

There are several algorithms that can be used to automate the process of finding a minimum path between two points.
Thus, this work aims to compare some of these possibilities (Breadth First Search, Uniform Cost Search, A * and
Greedy) using different heuristics through maps generated randomly where a point A (red) must reach a point B (blue).

    the codes used in this project here</a>.

##### Project 2 - Genetic Algorithms in Optimization of RFID Antenna Readings

For RFID antennas to work properly, the parameter settings of the modules must be well selected.
However, given the nature of the problem, this is not feasible to do by testing all possibilities.
In the search for brute force, an algorithm with an order of complexity **O(101<sup>n</sup>)** would be necessary, with
n = 31, in the simulation used in this project.
Thus, genetic algorithms were used in search of the ideal configuration result.
Different parameters were used in the algorithm, producing different solutions.
The results obtained solve the problem in different ways and are, in general, quite satisfactory.
**Our best algorithm achieved the ideal result in just 21s:38ms.** <a

##### Project 3 - Control Algorithm for Autonomous Robot Using Fuzzy Systems

Robots, sensors and scenarios were simulated using the V-REP software. Different scenarios were created so that the
robot could achieve objectives by avoiding obstacles. <a

    the codes used in this project here</a>.

##### Project 4 - Face Recognition

This work addresses the problem of face recognition in images through a regression tree algorithm using landmarks.
This project shows how the model was trained and evaluated. It also shows some practical applications.

Given a single photo and an associated name, the algorithm is able to recognize that person in other photos or videos,
even in real time. <a
